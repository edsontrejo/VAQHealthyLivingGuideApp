-Getting into the project-
cd <netbeans/projectfolder>					(where you want to do code, really)
git init							(initialize)
git remote add origin <project url clone>			(the repo is variable origin)
git pull origin master						(the project master in your folder)
git add *							(after changes, you stage it)
git commit -m "commit message"					(encouraged to make long messages)
git push origin master						(should be up the master in repo)

-Branching, please do this and not edit master, merge not here but later it will-
git branch <name-of-new-branch1>				(creates new branch, only you know, like mkdir)
git checkout <name-of-new-branch1>				(changes like cd, but internally)
git add *
git commit -m "experiment additions"
git push origin <name-of-new-branch1>				(puts the branch on github)
git checkout master						(returns back to master w/ master edits)
git checkout <name-of-new-branch1>				(returns bac to <n-o-n-b1> w/ its edits)
